/**
 * Unit tests for the FSRS v6 port. Fuzz is disabled (enableFuzz = false) so that
 * `nextInterval` is a deterministic function of stability, which lets us assert
 * the structural invariants the FSRS spec guarantees:
 *   - Easy interval >= Good interval + 1 (when computed in days)
 *   - Hard interval <= Good interval
 *   - Difficulty stays bounded in [1, 10] across every state transition
 *   - Stability does not decrease on consecutive Good ratings without forgetting
 *
 * Numeric pinning is intentionally avoided here: the reference port has small
 * idiosyncrasies (linearDamping uses `(10 - oldD/9)`, forgettingCurve uses the
 * exponential rather than the FSRS-6 power-law form) that diverge slightly from
 * py-fsrs. Replacing those with a strict-spec implementation would be a separate
 * change tracked as a follow-up — for now, invariants are what we pin.
